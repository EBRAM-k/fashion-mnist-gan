# Fashion MNIST GAN with CNN

This repository contains the implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to generate images similar to those in the Fashion MNIST dataset. The GAN architecture is implemented using the Keras library with TensorFlow as the backend.

## Introduction

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. They consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, which compete against each other. The generator tries to create realistic data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish between real and generated data.

In this project, we apply GANs to the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion categories. The goal is to train the generator to produce realistic images of clothing items.

## Architecture

The GAN consists of two primary components:

1. **Generator**: A deep neural network that takes random noise as input and generates images resembling the Fashion MNIST dataset.
2. **Discriminator**: A CNN that classifies images as either real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the generator).

### Generator Architecture
- Fully connected layers followed by reshaping.
- Several transposed convolutional layers (also known as deconvolution layers) to upsample the image.
- The final output is a 28x28 grayscale image.

### Discriminator Architecture
- Convolutional layers followed by batch normalization and LeakyReLU activations.
- The final layer outputs a single value indicating the probability that the input image is real.

## Requirements

To run this code, you need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
